We provide Joli as an ATS product to companies of various sizes, initially focussing on small and medium-sized corporations, with multiple rollouts planned in the future to large enterprises. The initial rollout is planned in the Netherlands and EU. As we grow in revenue and personnel numbers, we are expecting to release the product in various global markets as the need for fair hiring is universal.

The initial alpha phase is a data collection phase, where we provide a recommendation system trained on publicly available data, with an ATS providing basic features for SMEs. The data collected in this phase is then used to further train our AI.

Beta phase rollouts would provide more functionalities such as an improved resume parser, along with state-of-the-art open-source machine learning models that is trained on the collected data to provide fair personalized  recommendations based on company history. Improved charting and personalisation of features is provided for customers in this phase. 

The final 1.0 phase involves a complete product with features scalable to large enterprises that hire at scale, along with personalized branding & candidate onboarding features, candidate chat and automatic interview planning in the pipeline. We also aim to provide our core recommendations engine as a service, so that other players in the field can also benefit from our expertise in providing fair recommendations. This would be accessible through APIs.
