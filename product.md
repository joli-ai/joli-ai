<h2 id="content">Hiring is broken.</h2>
<p>Numerous studies have shown how candidates are overlooked just because of where they came from or how they look. We aim to fix that. While candidate recommendation systems have the power to reinforce the existing disparities present in hiring, they also have the power to alleviate it. We propose Joli as a solution to mitigate this problem.</p>

<h2 id="elements">Joli - Fair AI-based recommendations for applicant tracking</h2>
Joli is an AI-powered applicant tracking system (ATS) that helps to provide fair and personalized candidate recommendations for the hiring parties, without compromising on the skill levels and background of the candidates. Joli is built with an open-source core, the source code of which can be inspected and improved upon by the public worldwide.Â To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such case of an applicant tracking system to put fairness in hiring at the front and centre. We believe we are also the first to bring radical transparency into the hiring process, with the core candidate recommendation system being open for all to research, inspect and improve.
